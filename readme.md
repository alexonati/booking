- 3 types of users: normal user, restaurant owner (using Django Admin adjusted to have the appropriate features) & platform owner
- the normal  user can: add a photo to the profile, make a booking for a table in a restaurant, edit/delete the booking, add/delete/edit a review for each booking made
- the restaurant owner can: add/edit/delete restaurants & their details, add tables to each restaurant, see the bookings made for their restaurants & reviews for each booking.
- the platform owner can: all the restaurant owner can, but also adding/editing/deleting subscription fees
